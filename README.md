# TorontoMetMRP-EDA
This repository is strictly for the EDA portion of my Major Research Paper at Toronto Metropolitan University. 
Another repository will be created for future deliverables (and will include the contents in this one as well).

To run this notebook successfully, please follow the instructions below:
  1. Download the MRP_EDA_CHURN.ipynb file
  2. Download the Olist Dataset from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erak1006/brazilian-e-commerce-company-olist/data
  3. Create a local directory
  4. In the same directory where you upload the .ipynb file, create a folder called: Dataset
  5. Place all the data files into said folder
  6. Launch the notebook, and run each cell in sequence

Thank you!
